# .vsdconfig is never changed by vsd. If the user deletes it then
# the next time vsd is started it will be recreated with default values.
# Users can configure vsd by setting default values in this file.
# Any value set in .vsdconfig will override the same definition in .vsdrc.
# Make sure and put braces around the value if it contains whitespace.
# For example: set vsd(exec:lpr) {lpr -h}

# vsd(exec:lpr) is the name of the command used to print.
# It is called with one argument; the name of the file to be printed.
set vsd(exec:lpr) lpr

# vsd(exec:mail) is the name of the command used to send mail.
# It is called with one argument; the name of the user to send mail to.
# It also expects the message to mail from stdin.
set vsd(exec:mail) /usr/sbin/sendmail

# vsd(exec:date) is the name of the command used to get the date.
# It is called with no arguments.
set vsd(exec:date) date

# vsd(exec:uname) is the name of the command used to get system info.
# It is called with no arguments.
set vsd(exec:uname) {uname -a}

# Uncomment the next line if you do not want the cursor to blink.
# set vsd(cursorblink) 0
